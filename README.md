## 📈 Projects
This is my project portfolio.

### SQL-based Projects
- [Designing a Scalable Database for Greenspot Grocer Using MySQL](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/GreenspotGrocerDBDesign/blob/main/README.md) Utilised MySQL to restructure a `.csv` file into a scalable database. Techniques used `CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`, `INSERT INTO`, `JOIN` and `TRIGGER`. Also used MySQL Workbench's Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram builder to visually design the database structure.
- [Optimising Inventory for Strategic Warehouse Closure at Mint Classics Company](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/MintClassicsCo/blob/main/README.md) Utilised MySQL workbench for the analysis. Techniques such as JOINs, CTE, Sub-queries, filter clause (WHERE and HAVING) and Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN) were used.
- [Analysing Student Conversion and Engagement Metrics on the 365 E-Learning Platform](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/365E-LearningAnalysis) MySQL: Utilised MySQL workbench to analyse the dataset. Techniques such as JOINs, CTE and DATEDIFF were used.
- [8 Week SQL Challenge (Data with Danny)](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/8_Week_SQL_Challenge/blob/main/README.md) PostgreSQL with Docker: Utilised PostgreSQL to clean and analyze eight different data from banking and sales, to name a few. Implemented various SQL techniques including window functions and CTEs.

### Microsoft Excel-based Project
- [Football Transfer Analysis](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/ExcelFootballAnalysis/blob/main/README.md) Utilised MS Excel to clean and analyze three problems presented. Implemented various techniques to answer the problems such as INDEX/MATCH, UINIQUE/FILTER, SUMIFS, FIND/REPLACE and Formatting Cells.

### My Data Journey

On February 1st, 2023, I embarked on my journey in the field of data analytics. It has been quite a ride so far. I began by obtaining the Google Data Analytics Certification, dedicating ten weeks to intensive study and successfully completing the course.

Initially, my decision to pursue data analytics was to dip my toes in the water and see if it was the right path for me. However, I quickly discovered that I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. This marked the beginning of my hard work. I knew that the Google certification alone would not be sufficient to become a proficient data analyst. If I truly wanted to delve deeper into the world of data analytics, I had to put in the effort.

Consequently, I enrolled in the Excel Skills for Data Analytics and Visualization Course on Coursera. This course proved to be invaluable in expanding my understanding of data analysis using Excel.

My next objective was to acquire a deeper understanding of SQL. I began by taking the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Course, which served as an excellent introduction. However, as I progressed to Course 2, I found myself encountering unfamiliar concepts that were not adequately explained in a way that resonated with me. I realized that I needed to find another SQL course that would provide a more comprehensive understanding. That's when I came across Data with Danny Serious SQL.

Data with Danny Serious SQL turned out to be an exceptional resource. Through this course, I gained extensive knowledge ranging from simple data cleaning techniques to performing analytics in the fields of people and healthcare. Danny's lessons provided valuable insights that greatly enhanced my understanding of SQL.

I delved into visualisation through the Data Visualisation with Tableau Specialisation course. This course taught me the ins and outs of data visualisation. While the Google Data Analytics course introduced Tableau, it didn't explore the tool's full capabilities. The specialisation course, however, guided me through the entire data visualisation process from start to finish.

I've signed up for the Data Analyst course on 365 Data Science. This course will refresh my understanding of data analysis, especially what I've learned using Microsoft Excel and SQL. The course will cover Statistics and Python, which are key skills for a Data Analyst. It will also go deep into MS Excel and SQL, and I'm really excited to learn more about these.
